HuffManager is Java project that provides basic GUI application for working with archives. Archive has its root directory that can contain other 
directories and files. Files in archive are coded by codecs, which describe the general way how to code/decode streams of data. 
<p>
In this program 
there are two codecs implemented. One is Huffman codec, which is based on the Huffman coding 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">(more)</a>
, which codes streams of data by creating appropriate Huffman trees for them. The other codec is None codec, which does not code or decode data 
at all, it just works with streams of raw data, so it is a codec representation of not using a coder/decoder. 
<p>
Although these are the only implemented 
codecs, this application provides an easy way to add new codecs. New codec just has to extend the abstract class Codec. Providing access to
their Coder / Decoder classes that describe the coding / decoding process. The new codec should alse be registered in Codecs class that keeps track
of all known codecs. Once the new codec is added to the known codecs, it can be used in the GUI application to encode files in archive.
